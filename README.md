College Project Completed: Weather Forecast Application ðŸŒ¦  

I'm excited to share that I've successfully developed a Weather Forecast App as part of my college project using Java, XML, and integrated it with a real-time Weather API.  

ðŸ“± Key Features:    
- City-wise temperature, humidity & wind data  
- Clean & user-friendly UI  
- Integrated using API key for live data fetch  

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:  
- Java (Android)  
- XML (UI Design)  
- Weather API Integration  

This project helped me strengthen my skills in API handling, UI design, and Android development. Looking forward to exploring more real-world apps!  

Feel free to give feedback or suggestions ðŸ™Œ
